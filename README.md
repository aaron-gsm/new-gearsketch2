I do not take credit of the code - this was done by Frank Leenaars: https://github.com/frankleenaars/gearsketch

I have only added/changed some lines to the code to ask for the number of teeth each time a gear is drawn and to show text about the number of teeth. I am using this code for the convenience of my students to generate quickly some gears for their learning.
